## Experience
I have never participated in the real projects yet as I am just a beginner in the sphere of iOS development but I have a great passion for it and enjoy learning new things every day. Previously I worked as an HR record keeping manager and an IT recruiter on several projects as I enjoy communication and the fact that I can do something to improve the peopleâ€™s lives. 

At some point, about a year ago, I understood that I have a strong desire to create something, not only communicate and prepare some documents(but for sure this type of activity is really valuable too). I have always enjoyed using Apple products in my day-to-day activities, and started to learn Swift.
